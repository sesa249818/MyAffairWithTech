*writes down "1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 =" on a sheet of paper*
"What's that equal to?"
*counting* "Eight!"
*writes down another "1+" on the left*
"What about that?"
*quickly* "Nine!"
"How'd you know it was nine so fast?"
"You just added one more"
"So you didn't need to recount because you remembered there were eight! Dynamic Programming is just a fancy way to say 'remembering stuff to save time later'"
