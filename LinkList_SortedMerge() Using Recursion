SortedMerge() Using Recursion
Merge() is one of those nice recursive problems where the recursive solution code is
much cleaner than the iterative code. You probably wouldn't want to use the recursive
version for production code however, because it will use stack space which is
proportional to the length of the lists.

struct node* SortedMerge3(struct node* a, struct node* b) {
  struct node* result = NULL;
  // Base cases
  if (a==NULL) return(b);
  else if (b==NULL) return(a);
  // Pick either a or b, and recur
  if (a->data <= b->data) {
    result = a;
    result->next = SortedMerge3(a->next, b);
  }else {
    result = b;
    result->next = SortedMerge3(a, b->next);
  }
  return(result);
}
